        <h1>Why Should Egg Harbor Cafe Consider MTM?</h1>

        <br>

        <h2>Removal of limitations</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Hiring new employees for a job role with MTM in place will keep them from expecting to only do their duties of their job title.</li>

            <br>

            <li>There will be an evident equality from the dishwasher to the server in expectation and influence.</li>

            <br>

            <li>No matter the place you started within the company there would be equal opportunity for promotion and at the same rate. If you've demonstrated enough character to become team lead of any division within the structure of the company then there shouldn't be any other that would be considered before but instead on the same playing field.</li>

        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>An Additional Way to Implement EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System)</h2>

        <p>EOS is a set of simple concepts and practical tools that has helped thousands of entrepreneurs get what they want from their businesses. Implementing EOS starts with a premise that with a unified mind success is assured.</p>

        <ul>

            <li>Bringing all employees in your organization 100% on the same page with where you stand, where you’re going, and how you plan on arriving at your goals.</li>

            <br>

            <li>To reaffirm focus, discipline, and accountability throughout the company so that everyone executes on its vision, day in and day out.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Building your leaders to become a more cohesive, functional, and healthy leadership team.  This contributes to the overrall longevity and health of the company.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Surrounding company teams with great people, top to bottom, because without finding the best suited individuals no matter how long or temporary their participation there can be no growth or diverse innovation.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Using data means cutting through individual feelings, personal opinions and egos and boiling your organization down to a handful of objective numbers that give you an absolute pulse on where things are.</li>

            <br>

            <li>Strengthening around issues means becoming great at solving problems throughout the organization – setting them up, knocking them down and making them go away forever.</li>

            <br>

            <li>When you systemize your business by identifying and documenting the core processes that define the way to run your business. You’ll need to get everyone on the same page with what the essential procedural steps are, and then get everyone to follow them to create consistency and scalability in your organization.</li>
        
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>It's Already Present Within The Company</h2>

        <p>There are times and conditions within the flow of the day that everyone has to assist with some aspect of work that isn't apart of their designated position.  On a busy day where everyone is taking care of each step within their position, quite frequently someone isn't available to do something, at this point another individual with immediate time to react to the circumstance attempts to fulfill this task.  Most individuals who get promoted through the company have been in a progressive system.  For example, someone going from being a host, host team leader, and then to a server before being considered for the management role.  This demonstrates to the company this persons versatility and that they can handle more responsibility.   While they are going through this process their performance is being evaluated and the longer they remain with the company the more steps they take for growth within it.  This approach still remains the foundation of the MTM method.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Another example of this is when a particular store or set of stores are having a surge of business while the regional corporate level employees are present and they jump in to assist with whatever may be needed at the moment.  Now, this should be due to the fact that they've all had experience in one area or another on the ground floor of the company, but is not always the case.  Regardless, their participation is a direct representation of reminding everyone that they are on the same team with one common goal in mind.  I believe this creates and reinvigorates a positive moral in that instance.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Having a motto or vision of finding the right people for the right position within the right organization can be exemplified through MTM.  </p>
